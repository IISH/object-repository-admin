Just like the stagingarea where you upload files using ftp;
you can download ingested files using ftp as well.

[FileZilla|http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client] and [WinSCP|http://winscp.net/eng/download.php] are
ftp clients you can use. Or any other for that matter, provided you use these settings:

* connect to ftp.objectrepository.org
* set the ftp client to support an **implicit FTP over TLS** connection
* enable **passive mode**.
* your account is the same account with which you administer your object repository.
