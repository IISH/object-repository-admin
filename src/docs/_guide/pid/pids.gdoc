h3. files
When the StagingfileBindPIDs option was used, a call to the PID webservice will be made to bind the object-repository's
resolve URLs to this PID.

It will do so by convention:

@http://hdl.handle.net/[pid]?locatt=view:[level or master]@

This means there will be several persistent URLs. For example, if this was your PID: @12345/1.1@ then the persistent
URLs will be:

{table}
*view* | *persistent URL* | *Resolve Url*
metadata | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1.1 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/metadata/12345/1.1
master | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1.1?locatt=view:master | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/master/12345/1.1
level 1 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1.1?locatt=view:level1 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level1/12345/1.1
level 2 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1.1?locatt=view:level2 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1.1
level 3 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1.1?locatt=view:level3 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1.1

h3. compound object identifiers
When you use an objid the resolve URLs will be different and resolve to the METS document and PDF files. As an
extra feature it will point to the derivative of the first file the compound object consists of:

{table}
*view* | *persistent URL* | *Resolve Url*
mets | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/mets/12345/my-object-id
master | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id?locatt=view:master | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/mets/12345/my-object-id
pdf | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id?locatt=view:pdf | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/pdf/12345/my-object-id
level 1 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id?locatt=view:level1 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level1/12345/1.1
level 2 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id?locatt=view:level2 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1.1
level 3 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/my-object-id?locatt=view:level3 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1.1
{table}

The PDF made here is pointing to:
http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/pdf/12345/my-object-id/[@pdfLevel@]
where @pidLevel@ refers to the derivative level of the images that will become the pdf.
