h3. Expressing objid and order of files
The compound object has a persistent identifier. In the instruction this is set with the element *objid*
This is a PID just like the PIDs you supply to identify your files with.

In addition each individual file in the instruction may be given an order using the element *seq*.

As an example, take the situation where you offer a three page letter. You place it onto the staging area:
    {code}home-directory: /
        /folderA
        /folderA/page_0001.tiff
        /folderA/page_0002.tiff
        /folderA/page_0003.tiff{code}

Object ID and order is expressed this way in an instruction:
{code}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <instruction xmlns="http://objectrepository.org/instruction/1.0/" objid="12345/my-object-id">
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/my-identifier-a</pid>
            <seq>1</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00001.tiff</location>
            <md5>cf3ee1101d19328145e94da1cade45bd</md5>
        </stagingfile>
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/my-identifier-b</pid>
            <seq>2</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00002.tiff</location>
            <md5>f57eb0e65d11a5a73eab9d5dddf1e528</md5>
        </stagingfile>
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/another-identifier-c</pid>
            <seq>3</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00003.tiff</location>
            <md5>c741cd201fafb15c5ec874ae16738671</md5>
        </stagingfile>
    </instruction>{code}

If you autocreate an instruction, the seq element is always set in the alphabetical order of the files. An objid
can be set after the autocreate procedure is completed.

h3. The PID of the objid and it's resolve URLs
When you offer an objid together with at least one file that has a sequence value of 1, a PID will be declared at
the PID webservice. This pid will refer to:
* a METS document
* a PDF
* and to the derivative levels of the very first file.

See the [chapter on the pids|guide:pid/pids] what the resolve URLs will become.
