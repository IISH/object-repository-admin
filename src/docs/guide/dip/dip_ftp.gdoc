The content producer can place itself in the context of a consumer and download ingested files using ftp.

The ftp home directory will represent files in the same way as the masters were ingested. There is a folder for
 each of the stored master and it's derivatives there:
{code}/master
/level1
/level2
/level3{code}

The directory tree is similar to the way files are offered to the staging area at ingest time.
