Starting an instruction can be automated, provided the conditions are right. When an FTP client has uploaded files and
a valid XML processing instruction is in a main folder, the instruction will be
validated. If you had set the element ( in either the XML document itself or if not, at the profile panel ) :
{code}autoIngestValidInstruction=true{code} and the instruction is without error, the ingest of your files will commence
by itself.

This is the same for instructions that were automatically created using this setting.

If you disable @autoIngestValidInstruction@, then a start needs a manual command. From the administration interface
select @Ingest instruction@ to start.

{Note}The manual option to Ingest instruction will not appear until the instruction is considered valid.{Note}
