Just like the stagingarea where you upload files using ftp;
you can download ingested files using ftp as well.

[FileZilla|http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client] and [WinSCP|http://winscp.net/eng/download.php] are
ftp clients you can use. Or any other for that matter, provided you use these settings:

* connect to ftp.objectrepository.org
* set the ftp client to support an **implicit FTP over TLS** connection
* enable **passive mode**.
* your account is the same account with which you administer your object repository.

The ftp home directory will represent files in the same way as the masters were ingested. There is a folder for
 each of the stored master and it's derivatives there:
{code}/master
/level1
/level2
/level3{code}

The directory tree is similar to the way files are offered to the staging area at ingest time.
