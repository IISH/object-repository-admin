The object repository is part of a service oriented framework. It offers a collection of services:

* ftp upload of files to a staging area (temporary storage)
* ingesting those files and related metadata into persistent storage
* image, audio and video derivative generation
* accepts custom made derivatives of any content type
* persistent identifier creation by calling a PID webservice (binding resource and compound object locations and their
handles via a [PID webservice|]https://pid.socialhistoryservices.org/.)
* dissemination of the resources via HTTP and FTP
* exports compound objects by via METS and PDF
* an administration interface plus account system to manage the above services and access policies

h3. Purpose of this documentation
This document will describe two aspects which are outlined by this architecture:
* How it works: On the left side are the service levels placed in context. A description of them should make clear how the framework handles the digital information you supply to it.
* How to operate it: On the right is the administration panel where you manage your content. A guide will help you how to control it.
