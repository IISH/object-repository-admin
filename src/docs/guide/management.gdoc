The administration interface is where a CP administrator can:
 * create ftp accounts.
 * set a profile. That is, defaults for the processing instruction such as access, mimetype, the prefered services to use
 * define access policies
 * oversee the production of instructions, starting procedures and monitor the status
 * download technical metadata of stored material

 Access to the administration interface is possible via a privileged account only. Such accounts cannot be set
 via the administration interface directly. Contact the administrator directly to set such accounts.
