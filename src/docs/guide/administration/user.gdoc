The account section will allow you manage three types of access:
* ftp accounts for uploading and managing files on the staging area
* CP administrator accounts to operate the administration interface.
* A function of both accounts is to supply webservice keys. This key gives access to all admin and stored repository resources.

h2. create a user
You need to fill in or edit the following fields:

@Role@: *ROLE_CPADMIN* is the account with which a user can manage the administration panel. Although it is possible to upload
files with this account, it is wiser to use a ROLE_CPUSER account as it will prevent confusion regarding the location of the processing instruction.
* ROLE_CPUSER is intended for FTP purposes. One cannot operate the administration panel with an CPUSER account.
@Login name@: A user name containing letters and numbers
@Password@: If the password is left blank, a random password will be created
@E-mail@: The end-user's mail address.
@Enabled@: If on, the account can be used to login.

h2. user display
This view will also show the webservice key. The key is intended to access an object repository resource that is
normally closed for anonymous users. The key needs to be attached to the resolve URL that points to a resource.
Or be in the header file of a client that is responsible for downloading the files.

The webservice key has the same effect when a user uses a username and password to access the administration interface.

To modify the webservice key select "Change key"

h2. editing and removing
Any account can be modified, yet one cannot delete oneself however. Only a CP administrator can remove another CP
administrator.
