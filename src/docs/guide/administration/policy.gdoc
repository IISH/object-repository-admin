A policy determines what an _anonymous user_ ( lets say a person with a webbrowser who is not logged on to the
object repository ) can and cannot do. Access to each master file and its related derivatives are thus governed by a
policy.

{note}
A master file is always closed.
If you do not explicitly set a policy, the default will be closed.
{note}

There are three main policies available:
@access='open'@
All derivatives are viewable to the world

@access='restricted'@
Level 1 derivatives are restricted; level 2 and 3 are viewable to the world

@access='closed'@ (default)
no files can be downloaded or viewed
