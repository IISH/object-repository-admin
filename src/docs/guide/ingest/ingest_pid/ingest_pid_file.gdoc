The PID file service will bind persistent identifiers to resolve URLs of stored file's. It will use the Handle System's
capacity to handle multiple resolve URLs per PID. It will follow a convention to make such binds. For the PID:

@http://hdl.handle.net/[[persistent identifier]]?locatt=view:[[dissemination type]]@

and the bind to the resolve URL:

@http://[[object repository domain]]/file/[[dissemination type]]/[[persistent identifier]]

The @locatt@ is a qualifier that specifies the dissemination type. For as the dissemination package may offer several
views of the data, this qualifier will lead the consumer to them. For example, if this was your PID:

@12345/1@

then the persistent URLs of the master and derivatives become by convention:

{table}
*view* | *persistent URL* | *Resolve Url*
metadata | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/metadata/12345/1
master | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1?locatt=view:master | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/master/12345/1
level 1 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1?locatt=view:level1 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level1/12345/1
level 2 derivative | http://hdl.handle.net/12345/1?locatt=view:level2 | http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1

The requirements this service adheres to is for an addition or update action:
# Construct a PID webservice SOAP request. This request contains the persistent identifier; and the qualifiers per dissemination resolve URLs.
# Call the PID webservice using the PID webservice key.
# Check for the PID webservice response
## If an invalid or response, service unavailability or a failure message is in the response, then throw an error
# return success

For a delete action:
# remove the persistent identifier from the PID webservice
# Check for the PID webservice response
## If an invalid or response, service unavailability or a failure message is in the response, then throw an error
# return success
