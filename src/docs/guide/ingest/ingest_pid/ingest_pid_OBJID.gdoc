The PID OBJID service will bind a compound object's persistent identifier (the OBJID ) to the resolve URLs which will lead to
METS document and PDF file renderings. As an added feature it will point to the derivative of the first file the
compound object consists of. This latter will be usedfull to offer a preview image for the compound object.

Persistent identifiers convention for OBJIDs:
@http://hdl.handle.net/[persistent identifier]?locatt=view:[dissemination type]@
The resolve URL convention:
@http://[object repository domain]/file/[dissemination type]/[persistent identifier]

where @pidLevel@ refers to the derivative level of the images that will become the pdf.
