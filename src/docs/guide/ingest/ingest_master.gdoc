The Ingest master service is specifically intended to persist master files. It is the first task to do when an ingest
starts... when the plan is set so to ingest new or updated master files that is.

The requirements this service adheres to is for an addition or update action:
# look for the file on the staging area
## if found; add the file to the archival storage
### if not found; update the preservation description information in the archival package
### if no such information was known ( no persistent identifier ) throw an error
## compare the checksum between the submission package and the archival package
### when these match, add the preservation description information to the archival package.
### if there is a mismatch, throw an error
# return success

For a delete action:
# remove the content data objects ( the master file )
# check the removal
## verify the removal action. if it succeeded, continue
## if removal failed, throw an error
# remove the preservation description information
## verify the removal action. if it succeeded, continue
## if removal failed, throw an error
# return success
