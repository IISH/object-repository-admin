The Persistent identifier services will bind the fixity information to the resolve URLs of what is the dissemination
package. This will produce stable, resolvable URLs to the object repository's consumers.

These service are only available if the content producer has outsourced - or host - a PID webservice. The PID webservice
offers SOAP methods to manage the Handle System(r) resolution technology. As a PID webservice account is associated with
 a webservice key to operate it, the producer needs to add that key to their Profile.

Producers that have their own resolver technology should make such bindings themselves using the Dissemination conventions
available.
