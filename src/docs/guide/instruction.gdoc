The administration interface and an XML processing instruction together makes it all work.
An instruction has required and optional values. Those values can be set at three levels:

h4. 1. Profile
Via the administration interface select [profile|guide:administration/profile]. Default [instruction settings|guide:instruction/settings] can be
placed there by a CP administrator. It makes sense therefore, to set all your broad access policies and most frequently
used file content values here. Settings in the profile substitute any absent values in the XML processing instruction.

h4. 2. instruction.xml
The instruction.xml is a XML document. It's main element is named @instruction@ and contains attributes identical to
those you set in the profile. Any setting here will override those in the profile. Typically you would set values that
are exceptions to the more global general situation.

Each main folder ought to contain an XML document. However with automated creation of instructions you need no XML.

h4. 3. Stagingfile
In the instruction.xml's child elements one should mention @stagingfile@ elements. A stagingfile element represents the
file and any settings here will override those in the main element and profile.

The stagingfile is the only element that has some unique settings not present in the profile or instruction, such as md5,
location and pid value.

In short
Profile settings provide reasonable defaults for an organizations processing instruction.
Instruction settings in an instruction.xml document override profile values and provide specific defaults for
stagingfiles.
Stagingfile settings in their final turn override instruction and profile settings. The smallest always win.
