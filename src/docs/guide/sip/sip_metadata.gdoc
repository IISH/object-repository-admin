Metadata concern the files that are submitted for ingest; and also the operations needed to determine how these files are processed at ingest time in order to assemble the desired archival package.
Not all metadata needs to be supplied. The ingest procedure will add new content metadata about the stored media. For example image resolution, frames per second for movies.
Metadata is expressed via a processing instruction. The latter can be defined by the content producer via an XML document and through the administration panel.
