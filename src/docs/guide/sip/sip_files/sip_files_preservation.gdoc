Digital data that is intended to be preserved is designated as a "master". These are files whose content is to be stored perpetually. Such data is kept in a way to allow for media migration; and the automatic production of derivatives.
The data can be of any content type: audio, video, image, text, software. Simply put: a file with a name that has one or more bytes.
