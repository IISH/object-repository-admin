The validation service will ensure data integrity in all stages of the submission phase. When master files are ingested
this procedure will look if:
* all files in the staging area are in fact declared in the instruction as stagingfile elements
* all stagingfile elements in the instruction are indeed found the main folder content
* the md5 checksum values match
* a persistent identifier is present; and not used elsewhere in the instruction
* the file has one or more bytes

If the instruction is used for post-ingest operations (e.g. creation of derivatives, ingest of custom derivatives,
re-creation of labels or access policy) whereby an existing archival package is updated, this validation will only check
if the persistent identifier is registered.

A validated instruction without error will allow for an ingest to start.
