The validation service will ensure data integrity over all stages of the submission phase. When master files are ingested this procedure will look if:
* all files in the staging area are in fact declared in the instruction as stagingfile elements
* all stagingfile elements in the instruction are indeed found the main folder content
* the md5 checksum values match
* a persistent identifier is present; and not used elsewhere in the instruction
* the file has at least one byte

If the instruction is used for post-ingest operations (e.g. creation of derivatives, ingest of custom derivatives, re-creation of labels or access policy) whereby an existing archival package is updated, this validation will only check if the persistent identifier is registered.

This service will unlock the ingest service, after it confirmed the instruction is without error.
