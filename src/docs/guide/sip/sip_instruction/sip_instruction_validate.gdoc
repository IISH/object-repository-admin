The validation service will ensure data integrity over all stages of the submission phase. When master files are ingested this procedure will look if:
* all files in the staging area are in fact declared in the instruction as stagingfile elements
* all stagingfile elements in the instruction are indeed found the main folder content
* the md5 checksum values match
* a persistent identifier is present; and not used elsewhere in the instruction
* the file has at least one byte

If the instruction is used for post-ingest operations (e.g. creation of derivatives, ingest of custom derivatives, re-creation of labels or access policy) whereby an existing archival package is updated, this validation will only check if the persistent identifier is registered.

A validated instruction with no error will unlock the ingest service.
