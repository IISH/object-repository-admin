The content producer can automatically create the entire processing instruction. The service will calculate the
checksum and if desired reserve persistent identifier per file. Any other settings will be inherited from the Profile.

Note that the use of this service has an effect for the validation service. The latter will no longer apply a checksum
comparison between the content at the producer's side (outside the staging area that is ). And the material stored onto
the staging area. The content provider should decide if the transport is reliable enough to ensure the data's
integrity.
