The import service will read in a custom made processing instruction that is placed on the staging area. Provided:
* it is a well formed XML document;
* the submission package did not already include an instruction. A new instruction will only be accepted if a current processing instruction is cleared from the system via the administration panel.

After an import, the service will invoke the instructino validation service.
