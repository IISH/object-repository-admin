Metadata about the files is purely technical, administrative and structural in nature. A minimum amount of it is required for assembling a submission package:
* Access policies to indicate the  degrees of availability to the content consumer.
* A content type to identification of the digital files.
* Fixity: a MD5 checksum to ensure file transport integrity from the producer into the archival package.
* Reference: persistent identifiers to allow for access durability between information systems.
* Optional: a content producer may provide context information such as file order to describe physical relations ( pages of a book for example ) together with an optional reference to a bundled set of files.
