Metadata about the files is purely technical, administrative and structural in nature. And there is a minimum amount of it
required for assembling a submission package:
* Access policies to indicate the nature of  availability to the content consumer
* A content type to identification of the digital files
* Fixity: a MD5 checksum to ensure file transport integrity from the producer into the archival package
* Reference: persistent identifiers to allow for access durability between information systems

A content provider may provide context information such as file order to describe physical relations ( pages of a book
for example ) together with an optional reference to a bundled set of files.
