Descriptive metadata such as title, subject, or provenance is not part of the architecture of the object repository. Nor
does it facilitate discovery of content via a search-and-find solution. Seen from a perspective that goes beyond the
architecture of the repository the domain of descriptive metadata storage remains that of catalog, archival and library
systems. There reference information to the dissemination package in the object repository is expressed with persistent
identifiers.
