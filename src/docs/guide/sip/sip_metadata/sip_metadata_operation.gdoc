The submission packaged needs additional instructions to determine which services are invoked during ingest. Such
services involve amongst others:
* which files to add, delete or update
* if derivatives should be created
* if Persistent identifiers are to be created or bound

Like all other metadata, these operations are expressed via a processing instruction. The latter can be defined
by the content producer via an XML document and through the administration panel.
