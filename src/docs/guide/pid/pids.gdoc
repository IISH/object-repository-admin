When the StagingfileBindPIDs option was used, a call to the PID webservice will be made to bind the object-repository's
resolve URLs to this PID.

It will do so by convention:

@http://hdl.handle.net/[pid]?locatt=view:[level or master]@

This means there will be several persistent URLs. For example, if this was your PID: @12345/1.1@ then the persistent
URLs will be:
