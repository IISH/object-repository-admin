For each master and derivative there is a resolve url. The PID of the file is part of that url. The convention here
is that the:
resolve URL = http;//domain-of-the-repository/file/[master|level1|level2|level3]/[pid]

For example, if this was your PID: @12345/1.1@
And you created a level1, level2 and level3 derivative, then there are four resolve URLs in total to link to:

http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/master/12345/1.1
http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level1/12345/1.1
http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level2/12345/1.1
http://disseminate.objectrepository.org/file/level3/12345/1.1

If you create and bind your own PIDs, you know in advance ( before you ingest ) what the resolve URLs are.
