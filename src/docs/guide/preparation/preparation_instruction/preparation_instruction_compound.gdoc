Compound objects are abstractions of ordered files. The way you express a compound object is through the processing instruction.
Here you determine:
* the pid value to refer to a group of files
* the physical file order

This information is used to offer the download of METS documents and on the fly PDFs at the dissemination api or website.

h3. Expressing objid and order of files
The compound object has a persistent identifier. In the instruction this is set with the element *objid*
This is a PID just like the PIDs you supply to identify your files with.

In addition each individual file in the instruction may be given an order using the element *seq*.

As an example, take the situation where you offer a three page letter. You place it onto the staging area:
    {code}home-directory: /
        /folderA
        /folderA/page_0001.tiff
        /folderA/page_0002.tiff
        /folderA/page_0003.tiff{code}

Object ID and order is expressed this way in an instruction:
{code:xml}<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
    <instruction xmlns="http://objectrepository.org/instruction/1.0/" objid="12345/my-object-id">
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/my-identifier-a</pid>
            <seq>1</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00001.tiff</location>
            <md5>cf3ee1101d19328145e94da1cade45bd</md5>
        </stagingfile>
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/my-identifier-b</pid>
            <seq>2</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00002.tiff</location>
            <md5>f57eb0e65d11a5a73eab9d5dddf1e528</md5>
        </stagingfile>
        <stagingfile>
            <pid>12345/another-identifier-c</pid>
            <seq>3</seq>
            <location>/folderA/page_00003.tiff</location>
            <md5>c741cd201fafb15c5ec874ae16738671</md5>
        </stagingfile>
    </instruction>{code}

If you autocreate an instruction, the seq element is always set in the alphabetical order of the files. An objid
can be set after the autocreate procedure is completed.

When you offer an objid together with at least one file that has a sequence value of 1, a PID will be declared at
the PID webservice. For this the plan must have the workflow 'StagingFileBindObjId' set.
