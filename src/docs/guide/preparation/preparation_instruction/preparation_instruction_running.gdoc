Starting an instruction can be automated, provided the conditions are right:
* a FTP client has uploaded files
* a valid XML processing instruction is in a main folder; or you automatically created one via the administration's instruction panel
* If you had set the element ( in either the XML document itself or if not, at the profile panel ) :
{code}autoIngestValidInstruction=true{code}

If you disable @autoIngestValidInstruction@ a manual ingest command is needed. From the administration interface select @Process instruction@ to start.

{note}The manual option to Process an instruction will not appear until the instruction is considered valid.{note}
