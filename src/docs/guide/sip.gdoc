The stagingarea is where it all begins. Here the content producer - possibly through the agent of a digital archivist -
assembles the Digital files and metadata needed for the archival and dissemination package. This information can be
delivered via ftp for example, or by disk where an operator placed the content onto the staging area.

The manifest for this submission packaged is called a processing instruction. It declares the files placed on the staging
area and contains related metadata. This instruction can be custom made by the producer's own tools; or be partly or entirely manufactured inside the object repository administration panels.

The assembly of an submission package - and the archival ingest - can be completely automated or performed manually step-by-step.
