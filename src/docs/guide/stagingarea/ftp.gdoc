To connect to the staging area you need one or more ftp accounts which a CP administrator can via with the [Accounts section|guide:user].
at the administrator interface.

[FileZilla|http://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client] and [WinSCP|http://winscp.net/eng/download.php] are known to work well
with the staging area. To make a connection:
* create an ftp-account
* set the host name of the staging area to the one mentioned in the ftp account confirmation e-mail
* set the ftp client to support an **explicit FTP over TLS** connection
* enable **passive mode**.
* The ftp port to use is the default 21.

As a rule (and avoid confusion) use the CP user account to upload files and XML processing instructions with. Not your
CP administrator account.
