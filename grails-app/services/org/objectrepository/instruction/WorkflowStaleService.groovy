/**
 * WorkflowStaleService

 * Looks at each of the instruction and Stagingfile current status
 *
 * The service node will sent frequent status updated ( or confirmations of it ) to the status queue.
 * As the document.task.end date is then updated, we always know the process is still active.
 *
 * Should however the status not be updated... we have detected a problem.
 * Possible the service node has aborted a job and was not able to tell us about it. Or it did succeed
 *
 * In that case, the move the statusCode of the job to 600 and will await validation.
